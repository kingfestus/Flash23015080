"""
This is a basic fintech application with very basic functionalities using the console.
We will implement this using basic functions rather than classes.
however, this code shall be improved upon in later days.

The application shall contain the following basic features:
1. User Registration
2. Account Number generation
3. Deposit and Withdrawal feature
    For the withdrawal, we shall further have the below features
    1. Transfer
    2. Buy Airtime
    3. Data subscription
4. Check balance
5. Retrieve Account Number

INSTRUCTIONS: You are not allowed to delete any code written here rather, update the part with the # to perform the
expected output, ensure to test your codes progressively
